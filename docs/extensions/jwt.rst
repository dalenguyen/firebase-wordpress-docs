This add-on is still in beta. There is a POC (Proof of Concept), but I'm not promised if it is a good product and there's a need or it or not. We'll firgure it out.

Remote Authentication (via URL)
----------------------------------

Imagine that you have a Firebase App that users can log in to. However, before they can use your app, users need to purchase a package that will give them permission. And this product will help to auto-login users from your Firebase App to your WooCommerce / WordPress website. This add-on doesn't care if users exist in WP or not, it just log users in with Firbase credentials. That's it.
