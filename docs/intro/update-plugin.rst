Update the Plugin
=============

The plugin is not in WordPress.org, you can not update automatically through WordPress dashboard.

There are two ways that you can update the plugin to a newer version without losing the current settings. Please don't delete the plugin and reinstall it, you will have to reconfigure the plugin again if you do that. 

Before updating, please check the **readme.txt** for instruction.
