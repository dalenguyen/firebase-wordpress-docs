Firebase User Profile on WordPress
=============

You have ability to manage Firebase Users account from WordPress. For example, User is managed in Firestore under **‘users‘** collection and the document is the Firebase UID.

Then you can create a Contact 7 form with the fields that represent your users information.

*Note: the form only supports text, tel, number, date and radio at the moment.

Remember to set the security rule that only allows user to update their own data.

    match /users/{userId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
