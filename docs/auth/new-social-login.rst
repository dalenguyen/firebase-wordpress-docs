Social Login (NEW)
=============

This feature is added since v3.5.0. The purpose of this feature is to provide a all in one place authentication flow for customers. Customers will have options to login either using social media, phone (OTP) or email & password without leaving the current page.

What you need to do is add this shortcode to any page, then you will have a complete social login.

    [firebase_auth redirect="/" send_email_confirmation=true]
